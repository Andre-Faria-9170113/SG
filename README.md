# SG-FruitSamurai

Three.js-based game heavily inspired by the mobile game "Fruit Ninja". This Project was developed as part of the "Sistemas Gráficos" course, integrated in the second year curriculum of the TSIW degree at ESMAD.

## Prerequisites

-Any regular web browser (Microsoft Edge is recommended, as it's the only browser we tested that doesn't bring up security-related problems by default).

## Getting Started

-To play the game, open the fruitNinja.html page in the "Fruit Samurai" folder;

-The goal of the game is to achieve as high of a score as possible, by slicing the various coloured fruits that are launched across the screen. If
a fruit leaves the screen without being sliced, the player loses one life (of a starting total of three lives). The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

## Player Controls

Mouse Drag - Move the blade around the screen.

Left Click - Vertical Slice.

Left Click + Left Shift - Horizontal Slice.

NOTE: In the case of a Game Over, press any key to restart the game.
